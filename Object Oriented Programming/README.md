# Object Oriented Programming

## Programming Paradimes

## CLASSES
Class creates a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. 
## OBJECT 
An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.
